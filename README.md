This is the version 1.0 code of the work :  
  'Scalable Active Learning by Approximated Error Reduction'
Of note, we use the FLANN package for approximate nearest neighbors searching. You can see http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/#download and find its implementing detials.

The datasets used in our experiments can be download at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ntyr9rOV17KNynDcBjtGLk8lWdPTuFLV
